# Hippo-Spotamus: A Spotify Recommendation System

In a world where the availability of good music is at an all time high but searchability is routinely overwhelming, more than ever, we need the ability to locate that perfect song to throw on. From car ride jams to late night study time, personalize your preferences in order to find your ideal playlist for any occasion! With this project, your recommended playlists are no longer bound by genre, artist, or any other label that might prevent you from reaching the perfect song! For more information, please read the Group Report.
